## Operating a retail store calls for a range of administrative, management and marketing skills. From ensuring that there’s enough inventory to putting together monthly sales reports, these skills are necessary for your store to run smoothly. For solving this problem we come up with Tally Note, which is based on a theme called the Point of Sale (POS) System. Let's Talk about this "Point of Sale System". ##

Having an efficient point of sale (POS) system can go a long way in making sure that all your operations are working in unison, and retailers that spend the time and resources to implement such a system before they need it will reap the benefits.

## What is Point of Sale System? ##
A point of sale system, or POS, is the place where your customer makes a payment for products or services at your store. Simply put, every time a customer makes a purchase, they’re completing a point of sale transaction.

In fact, according to a survey we conducted among retailers last fall (methodology below), nearly a quarter of the business leaders we polled (23%) prioritized their point of sale infrastructure (upgrading an existing system or investing in a new POS system) more during COVID-19, while the remaining 43% maintained their pre-pandemic level of prioritization. In other words, even in the event of a global pandemic, two-thirds of retail executives were unwilling or unable to deprioritize POS equipment.
So, we followed POS System in building Tally Note.
