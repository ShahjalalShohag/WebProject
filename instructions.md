# Instructions to run the Project: 
Here we have an easy instruction on how to run Tally Note

## Step 1: Installation & Setting up a localhost server
First of all we need to download a suitable localhost server application into our pc. The most popular localhost server applicatons are below:
- `XAMPP` 
- `WampServer`
- `MAMP`
- `AMPPS`
- `EasyPHP`
- `WPN-XM`
 
Choose one of them, and then install it. Install the application into a specific dedicated folder and remember the path. Complete the installation process step by step. 

## Step 2: Launch the Localhost server Application
Run the app and activate the `Apache` and `MySQL` Modules. `Start` the action buttons under those modules. This process will run the localhost server on your device.

## Step 3: Download the project
Visit [This](https://github.com/ShahjalalShohag/WebProject) web address. Then hit the `Code` Button, and from the dropdown menu choose the `Download Zip`. It start downloading. After downloading unZIP the downloaded file.

## Step 4: Move the Project files
Remerber the specific dedicated folder ( suppose `C:\xampp` ) we installed the localhost server application. Browse that folder and find `htdocs` subfolder ( suppose `C:\xampp\htdocs` ) into it then place the unzipped downloaded project file here.

## Step 5: Database Management
You will find a `.sql` File among the unzipped downloaded project files. This file contains code to work with relational databases. Then, go to the localhost server applications control panel and under `MySQL` module, hit the `Admin` button. This will bring you to the `phpMyAdmin` interface for maintaining databases or you can to your browser and search [http://localhost/phpmyadmin/](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/). Then, Hit the `New` button and create a new database with a specific name (Suppose, for this project `pos`). Then `Import` the `.sql` file into the just created new database. Now you are good to go, Run the project.

## Step : Run the Project
Go to any of your installed browser and type in the `searchbar` `http://localhost/ProjectName/`, hit `Enter`. Then the project will run automatically.
