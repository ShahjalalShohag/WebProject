# Tally Note

Tally Note uses the theme of `Point of Sale System` to operate a retail store calls for a range of administrative, management and marketing skills.

# Description

Operating a retail store calls for a range of administrative, management and marketing skills. From ensuring that there’s enough inventory to putting together monthly sales reports, these skills are necessary for your store to run smoothly. For solving this problem we come up with Tally Note, which is based on a theme called the Point of Sale (POS) System. Let's Talk about this "Point of Sale System".

Having an efficient point of sale (POS) system can go a long way in making sure that all your operations are working in unison, and retailers that spend the time and resources to implement such a system before they need it will reap the benefits.

## What is Point of Sale System? ##
A point of sale system, or POS, is the place where your customer makes a payment for products or services at your store. Simply put, every time a customer makes a purchase, they’re completing a point of sale transaction.

In fact, according to a survey we conducted among retailers last fall (methodology below), nearly a quarter of the business leaders we polled (23%) prioritized their point of sale infrastructure (upgrading an existing system or investing in a new POS system) more during COVID-19, while the remaining 43% maintained their pre-pandemic level of prioritization. In other words, even in the event of a global pandemic, two-thirds of retail executives were unwilling or unable to deprioritize POS equipment.
So, we followed POS System in building Tally Note.

## Hardware components of Tally Note: ##
- Monitor/tablet
- Barcode scanner
- Credit card reader
- Receipt printer
- Cash drawer

## Key Features of Tally Note: ##
- Sales Reporting
- Inventory Management
- Customer Management
- Employee Reporting and Management

## Sales Reporting: ##
Tally Note allow you to glance at your sales on the surface. The difference is in the presentation of those figures, the simplicity with which data can be accessed, and the level of detail provided.
### Tally Note should ideally be able to: ###
- Generate detailed sales reports (based on product, hour, employee, total cost of items sold, total retail amount, net profit, profit percentage, gross margin)
- Provide quick snapshots and charts on your store’s sales performance
## Inventory Management: ##
Inventory management, one of Tally Note's most significant features, keeps track of all products so you know when it's time to order (or not order) specific items.
### Tally Note should ideally be able to: ###
- Scan and count products digitally
- Manage your stock by creating product variations (size, color)
- Identify pieces of inventory with a unique serial number
- Track inventory levels across multiple locations
- Enable seamless ordering such as automatically setting custom reorders of best-sellers
- Consolidate purchases and orders in one order
## Customer Management: ##
Customers who have great ties with you are more likely to do business with you again. Customer relationship management (CRM) should be included in Tally Note to keep track of all customer information.

# Instructions

# Instructions to run the Project: 
Here we have an easy instruction on how to run Tally Note

## Step 1: Installation & Setting up a localhost server
First of all we need to download a suitable localhost server application into our pc. The most popular localhost server applicatons are below:
- `XAMPP` 
- `WampServer`
- `MAMP`
- `AMPPS`
- `EasyPHP`
- `WPN-XM`
 
Choose one of them, and then install it. Install the application into a specific dedicated folder and remember the path. Complete the installation process step by step. 

## Step 2: Launch the Localhost server Application
Run the app and activate the `Apache` and `MySQL` Modules. `Start` the action buttons under those modules. This process will run the localhost server on your device.

## Step 3: Download the project
Visit [This](https://github.com/ShahjalalShohag/WebProject) web address. Then hit the `Code` Button, and from the dropdown menu choose the `Download Zip`. It start downloading. After downloading unZIP the downloaded file.

## Step 4: Move the Project files
Remerber the specific dedicated folder ( suppose `C:\xampp` ) we installed the localhost server application. Browse that folder and find `htdocs` subfolder ( suppose `C:\xampp\htdocs` ) into it then place the unzipped downloaded project file here.

## Step 5: Database Management
You will find a `.sql` File among the unzipped downloaded project files. This file contains code to work with relational databases. Then, go to the localhost server applications control panel and under `MySQL` module, hit the `Admin` button. This will bring you to the `phpMyAdmin` interface for maintaining databases or you can to your browser and search [http://localhost/phpmyadmin/](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/). Then, Hit the `New` button and create a new database with a specific name (Suppose, for this project `pos`). Then `Import` the `.sql` file into the just created new database. Now you are good to go, Run the project.

## Step : Run the Project
Go to any of your installed browser and type in the `searchbar` `http://localhost/ProjectName/`, hit `Enter`. Then the project will run automatically.
